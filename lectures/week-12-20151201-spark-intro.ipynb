An RDD leverages the data- and computing resource-tracking capabilities of the Hadoop infrastructure layer to make a dataset available in RAM.  This is a key enhancement over the Hadoop or broader Map/Reduce model where data for every step of computation comes from disk and returns to disk between steps.  Using RAM like this makes everything go faster.\n",

To do this we need to map each input line and extract the start and stop station, then we need to reduce that by aggregating the count lines.
