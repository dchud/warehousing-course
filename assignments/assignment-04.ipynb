    "# Assignment 4 - Due Tuesday, October 13 at 10pm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**:  Gain experience loading a CSV dataset into a database and using SQL to explore its contents.  Write and execute a number of SQL queries using common syntax and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading criteria**: The tasks should all be completed, and questions should all be answered. Results should be correct, according to a specific answer key.  The notebook itself should be completely reproducible; from start to finish, another person should be able to use the same code to obtain the same results as yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline**: Tuesday, October 13, 2015, 10pm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder**: We will not meet on Tuesday, October 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll download a clean CSV dataset from data.gov, load it into a SQLite database, and perform a series of queries to answer several questions.  For each problem, write and execute queries that provides the answer.  Turn in your notebook with your output and a PDF version with your output together in a single zip file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you need not add narrative description to most of your queries, although you may do so if something you see in the data prompts you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggestion**: if you have worked through the [Software Carpentry SQL lessons](http://swcarpentry.github.io/sql-novice-survey/) and have run through the [Exercise notebook from class October 6](https://github.com/dchud/warehousing-course/blob/master/lectures/week-05-20151006-basic-sql.ipynb), this should all be fairly easy.  If you have done neither, do them now, before you begin."
